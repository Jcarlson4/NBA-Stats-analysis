# NBA-Stats-analysis
# Overview
A program written to insert data from a CSV file containing Stats from the last NBA playoffs and to pull that data to answer some questions about the stats.


The data set that I used for this program was an NBA stats excel file which I converted into a CSV. 

Here is the Link to that file,

The purpose of my software was to connect to a database then be able to select data from the database to be able to analyze the data. For example, with this data set I inserted it all into a table and called information from the table that i thought was interesting.

# Data Analysis Results

WHo was the player that averaged the most points during the playoffs? 
That player was Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks at 33 ppg

WHo was the player that had the most usage while on the court?
This player was Willy Hernangomez of the New Orleans Pelicans. Luke Doncic was number 4 on this list.

# Development Environment

I primarily used Python and MySQL. I originally created the program using the python library of Pandas, however, i wanted to be able to store the data in a location other than just in my files and the database was able to accommplish this and kind of eliminated the need for Pandas all together.

# Future Work

Insert code into the program to be able to create an NBADB and player table.
Insert another table to be about the regular season.
Create more queries to answer more questions about the data set.
